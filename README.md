# CodingQuiz
This is a quick little html quiz with a timer that starts off at 110 seconds, that everytime you answer a question wrong you get a 15 second deduction on your time remaining from the clock. Once you finish the quiz it takes the time remaining and makes that your score and adds it to the highscore page with you can reset or reference old scores at anytime using local storage.
